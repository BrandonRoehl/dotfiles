# Apply a font feature. To enable multiple font features you can repeat
# this multiple times or use a comma-separated list of feature settings.
# 
# The syntax for feature settings is as follows, where `feat` is a feature:
# 
#   * Enable features with e.g. `feat`, `+feat`, `feat on`, `feat=1`.
#   * Disabled features with e.g. `-feat`, `feat off`, `feat=0`.
#   * Set a feature value with e.g. `feat=2`, `feat = 3`, `feat 4`.
#   * Feature names may be wrapped in quotes, meaning this config should be
#     syntactically compatible with the `font-feature-settings` CSS property.
# 
# The syntax is fairly loose, but invalid settings will be silently ignored.
# 
# The font feature will apply to all fonts rendered by Ghostty. A future
# enhancement will allow targeting specific faces.
# 
# To disable programming ligatures, use `-calt` since this is the typical
# feature name for programming ligatures. To look into what font features
# your font has and what they do, use a font inspection tool such as
# [fontdrop.info](https://fontdrop.info).
# 
# To generally disable most ligatures, use `-calt, -liga, -dlig`.
font-feature = -calt
font-feature = -liga
font-feature = -dlig

# A theme to use. This can be a built-in theme name, a custom theme
# name, or an absolute path to a custom theme file. Ghostty also supports
# specifying a different theme to use for light and dark mode. Each
# option is documented below.
# 
# If the theme is an absolute pathname, Ghostty will attempt to load that
# file as a theme. If that file does not exist or is inaccessible, an error
# will be logged and no other directories will be searched.
# 
# If the theme is not an absolute pathname, two different directories will be
# searched for a file name that matches the theme. This is case sensitive on
# systems with case-sensitive filesystems. It is an error for a theme name to
# include path separators unless it is an absolute pathname.
# 
# The first directory is the `themes` subdirectory of your Ghostty
# configuration directory. This is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ghostty/themes` or
# `~/.config/ghostty/themes`.
# 
# The second directory is the `themes` subdirectory of the Ghostty resources
# directory. Ghostty ships with a multitude of themes that will be installed
# into this directory. On macOS, this list is in the
# `Ghostty.app/Contents/Resources/ghostty/themes` directory. On Linux, this
# list is in the `share/ghostty/themes` directory (wherever you installed the
# Ghostty "share" directory.
# 
# To see a list of available themes, run `ghostty +list-themes`.
# 
# A theme file is simply another Ghostty configuration file. They share
# the same syntax and same configuration options. A theme can set any valid
# configuration option so please do not use a theme file from an untrusted
# source. The built-in themes are audited to only set safe configuration
# options.
# 
# Some options cannot be set within theme files. The reason these are not
# supported should be self-evident. A theme file cannot set `theme` or
# `config-file`. At the time of writing this, Ghostty will not show any
# warnings or errors if you set these options in a theme file but they will
# be silently ignored.
# 
# Any additional colors specified via background, foreground, palette, etc.
# will override the colors specified in the theme.
# 
# To specify a different theme for light and dark mode, use the following
# syntax: `light:theme-name,dark:theme-name`. For example:
# `light:Rose Pine Dawn,dark:Rose Pine`. Whitespace around all values are
# trimmed and order of light and dark does not matter. Both light and dark
# must be specified in this form. In this form, the theme used will be
# based on the current desktop environment theme.
# 
# There are some known bugs with light/dark mode theming. These will
# be fixed in a future update:
# 
#   - macOS: titlebar tabs style is not updated when switching themes.

# The color of the cursor. If this is not set, a default will be chosen.
# 
# Direct colors can be specified as either hex (`#RRGGBB` or `RRGGBB`)
# or a named X11 color.
# 
# Additionally, special values can be used to set the color to match
# other colors at runtime:
# 
#   * `cell-foreground` - Match the cell foreground color.
#     (Available since: 1.2.0)
# 
#   * `cell-background` - Match the cell background color.
#     (Available since: 1.2.0)

# cursor-color = cell-foreground

# The opacity level (opposite of transparency) of the cursor. A value of 1
# is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. A value less than 0
# or greater than 1 will be clamped to the nearest valid value. Note that a
# sufficiently small value such as 0.3 may be effectively invisible and may
# make it difficult to find the cursor.
cursor-opacity = 1

# The style of the cursor. This sets the default style. A running program can
# still request an explicit cursor style using escape sequences (such as `CSI
# q`). Shell configurations will often request specific cursor styles.
# 
# Note that shell integration will automatically set the cursor to a bar at
# a prompt, regardless of this configuration. You can disable that behavior
# by specifying `shell-integration-features = no-cursor` or disabling shell
# integration entirely.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * `block`
#   * `bar`
#   * `underline`
#   * `block_hollow`
cursor-style = block

# Sets the default blinking state of the cursor. This is just the default
# state; running programs may override the cursor style using `DECSCUSR` (`CSI
# q`).
# 
# If this is not set, the cursor blinks by default. Note that this is not the
# same as a "true" value, as noted below.
# 
# If this is not set at all (`null`), then Ghostty will respect DEC Mode 12
# (AT&T cursor blink) as an alternate approach to turning blinking on/off. If
# this is set to any value other than null, DEC mode 12 will be ignored but
# `DECSCUSR` will still be respected.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * ` ` (blank)
#   * `true`
#   * `false`

# The color of the text under the cursor. If this is not set, a default will
# be chosen.
# Specified as either hex (`#RRGGBB` or `RRGGBB`) or a named X11 color.
# Since version 1.2.0, this can also be set to `cell-foreground` to match
# the cell foreground color, or `cell-background` to match the cell
# background color.

# Custom shaders to run after the default shaders. This is a file path
# to a GLSL-syntax shader for all platforms.
# 
# Warning: Invalid shaders can cause Ghostty to become unusable such as by
# causing the window to be completely black. If this happens, you can
# unset this configuration to disable the shader.
# 
# Custom shader support is based on and compatible with the Shadertoy shaders.
# Shaders should specify a `mainImage` function and the available uniforms
# largely match Shadertoy, with some caveats and Ghostty-specific extensions.
# 
# The uniform values available to shaders are as follows:
# 
#  * `sampler2D iChannel0` - Input texture.
# 
#    A texture containing the current terminal screen. If multiple custom
#    shaders are specified, the output of previous shaders is written to
#    this texture, to allow combining multiple effects.
# 
#  * `vec3 iResolution` - Output texture size, `[width, height, 1]` (in px).
# 
#  * `float iTime` - Time in seconds since first frame was rendered.
# 
#  * `float iTimeDelta` - Time in seconds since previous frame was rendered.
# 
#  * `float iFrameRate` - Average framerate. (NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED)
# 
#  * `int iFrame` - Number of frames that have been rendered so far.
# 
#  * `float iChannelTime[4]` - Current time for video or sound input. (N/A)
# 
#  * `vec3 iChannelResolution[4]` - Resolutions of the 4 input samplers.
# 
#    Currently only `iChannel0` exists, and `iChannelResolution[0]` is
#    identical to `iResolution`.
# 
#  * `vec4 iMouse` - Mouse input info. (NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED)
# 
#  * `vec4 iDate` - Date/time info. (NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED)
# 
#  * `float iSampleRate` - Sample rate for audio. (N/A)
# 
# Ghostty-specific extensions:
# 
#  * `vec4 iCurrentCursor` - Info about the terminal cursor.
# 
#    - `iCurrentCursor.xy` is the -X, +Y corner of the current cursor.
#    - `iCurrentCursor.zw` is the width and height of the current cursor.
# 
#  * `vec4 iPreviousCursor` - Info about the previous terminal cursor.
# 
#  * `vec4 iCurrentCursorColor` - Color of the terminal cursor.
# 
#  * `vec4 iPreviousCursorColor` - Color of the previous terminal cursor.
# 
#  * `float iTimeCursorChange` - Timestamp of terminal cursor change.
# 
#    When the terminal cursor changes position or color, this is set to
#    the same time as the `iTime` uniform, allowing you to compute the
#    time since the change by subtracting this from `iTime`.
# 
# If the shader fails to compile, the shader will be ignored. Any errors
# related to shader compilation will not show up as configuration errors
# and only show up in the log, since shader compilation happens after
# configuration loading on the dedicated render thread.  For interactive
# development, use [shadertoy.com](https://shadertoy.com).
# 
# This can be repeated multiple times to load multiple shaders. The shaders
# will be run in the order they are specified.
# 
# This can be changed at runtime and will affect all open terminals.
