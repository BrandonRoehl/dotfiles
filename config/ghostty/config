# FreeType load flags to enable. The format of this is a list of flags to
# enable separated by commas. If you prefix a flag with `no-` then it is
# disabled. If you omit a flag, its default value is used, so you must
# explicitly disable flags you don't want. You can also use `true` or `false`
# to turn all flags on or off.
# 
# This configuration only applies to Ghostty builds that use FreeType.
# This is usually the case only for Linux builds. macOS uses CoreText
# and does not have an equivalent configuration.
# 
# Available flags:
# 
#   * `hinting` - Enable or disable hinting. Enabled by default.
# 
#   * `force-autohint` - Always use the freetype auto-hinter instead of
#     the font's native hinter. Disabled by default.
# 
#   * `monochrome` - Instructs renderer to use 1-bit monochrome rendering.
#     This will disable anti-aliasing, and probably not look very good unless
#     you're using a pixel font. Disabled by default.
# 
#   * `autohint` - Enable the freetype auto-hinter. Enabled by default.
# 
# Example: `hinting`, `no-hinting`, `force-autohint`, `no-force-autohint`

# Hide the mouse immediately when typing. The mouse becomes visible again
# when the mouse is used (button, movement, etc.). Platform-specific behavior

# Multiplier for scrolling distance with the mouse wheel.
# 
# A prefix of `precision:` or `discrete:` can be used to set the multiplier
# only for scrolling with the specific type of devices. These can be
# comma-separated to set both types of multipliers at the same time, e.g.
# `precision:0.1,discrete:3`. If no prefix is used, the multiplier applies
# to all scrolling devices. Specifying a prefix was introduced in Ghostty
# 1.2.1.
# 
# The value will be clamped to [0.01, 10,000]. Both of these are extreme
# and you're likely to have a bad experience if you set either extreme.
# 
# The default value is "3" for discrete devices and "1" for precision devices.

# The opacity level (opposite of transparency) of an unfocused split.
# Unfocused splits by default are slightly faded out to make it easier to see
# which split is focused. To disable this feature, set this value to 1.
# 
# A value of 1 is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. Because
# "0" is not useful (it makes the window look very weird), the minimum value
# is 0.15. This value still looks weird but you can at least see what's going
# on. A value outside of the range 0.15 to 1 will be clamped to the nearest
# valid value.
unfocused-split-opacity = 1

# The command to run, usually a shell. If this is not an absolute path, it'll
# be looked up in the `PATH`. If this is not set, a default will be looked up
# from your system. The rules for the default lookup are:
# 
#   * `SHELL` environment variable
# 
#   * `passwd` entry (user information)
# 
# This can contain additional arguments to run the command with. If additional
# arguments are provided, the command will be executed using `/bin/sh -c`
# to offload shell argument expansion.
# 
# To avoid shell expansion altogether, prefix the command with `direct:`, e.g.
# `direct:nvim foo`. This will avoid the roundtrip to `/bin/sh` but will also
# not support any shell parsing such as arguments with spaces, filepaths with
# `~`, globs, etc. (Available since: 1.2.0)
# 
# You can also explicitly prefix the command with `shell:` to always wrap the
# command in a shell. This can be used to ensure our heuristics to choose the
# right mode are not used in case they are wrong. (Available since: 1.2.0)
# 
# This command will be used for all new terminal surfaces, i.e. new windows,
# tabs, etc. If you want to run a command only for the first terminal surface
# created when Ghostty starts, use the `initial-command` configuration.
# 
# Ghostty supports the common `-e` flag for executing a command with
# arguments. For example, `ghostty -e fish --with --custom --args`.
# This flag sets the `initial-command` configuration, see that for more
# information.
command = /bin/zsh

# The theme to use for the windows. Valid values:
# 
#   * `auto` - Determine the theme based on the configured terminal
#      background color. This has no effect if the "theme" configuration
#      has separate light and dark themes. In that case, the behavior
#      of "auto" is equivalent to "system".
#   * `system` - Use the system theme.
#   * `light` - Use the light theme regardless of system theme.
#   * `dark` - Use the dark theme regardless of system theme.
#   * `ghostty` - Use the background and foreground colors specified in the
#     Ghostty configuration. This is only supported on Linux builds.
# 
# On macOS, if `macos-titlebar-style` is "tabs", the window theme will be
# automatically set based on the luminosity of the terminal background color.
# This only applies to terminal windows. This setting will still apply to
# non-terminal windows within Ghostty.
# 
# This is currently only supported on macOS and Linux.
window-theme = system

# Whether to automatically copy selected text to the clipboard. `true`
# will prefer to copy to the selection clipboard, otherwise it will copy to
# the system clipboard.
# 
# The value `clipboard` will always copy text to the selection clipboard
# as well as the system clipboard.
# 
# Middle-click paste will always use the selection clipboard. Middle-click
# paste is always enabled even if this is `false`.
# 
# The default value is true on Linux and macOS.
copy-on-select = false

# The time in milliseconds between clicks to consider a click a repeat
# (double, triple, etc.) or an entirely new single click. A value of zero will
# use a platform-specific default. The default on macOS is determined by the
# OS settings. On every other platform it is 500ms.
click-repeat-interval = 500

# Put every surface (tab, split, window) into a dedicated Linux cgroup.
# 
# This makes it so that resource management can be done on a per-surface
# granularity. For example, if a shell program is using too much memory,
# only that shell will be killed by the oom monitor instead of the entire
# Ghostty process. Similarly, if a shell program is using too much CPU,
# only that surface will be CPU-throttled.
# 
# This will cause startup times to be slower (a hundred milliseconds or so),
# so the default value is "single-instance." In single-instance mode, only
# one instance of Ghostty is running (see gtk-single-instance) so the startup
# time is a one-time cost. Additionally, single instance Ghostty is much
# more likely to have many windows, tabs, etc. so cgroup isolation is a
# big benefit.
# 
# This feature requires systemd. If systemd is unavailable, cgroup
# initialization will fail. By default, this will not prevent Ghostty
# from working (see linux-cgroup-hard-fail).
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * `never` - Never use cgroups.
#   * `always` - Always use cgroups.
#   * `single-instance` - Enable cgroups only for Ghostty instances launched
#     as single-instance applications (see gtk-single-instance).
linux-cgroup = single-instance

# Control the auto-update functionality of Ghostty. This is only supported
# on macOS currently, since Linux builds are distributed via package
# managers that are not centrally controlled by Ghostty.
# 
# Checking or downloading an update does not send any information to
# the project beyond standard network information mandated by the
# underlying protocols. To put it another way: Ghostty doesn't explicitly
# add any tracking to the update process. The update process works by
# downloading information about the latest version and comparing it
# client-side to the current version.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `off` - Disable auto-updates.
#  * `check` - Check for updates and notify the user if an update is
#    available, but do not automatically download or install the update.
#  * `download` - Check for updates, automatically download the update,
#    notify the user, but do not automatically install the update.
# 
# If unset, we defer to Sparkle's default behavior, which respects the
# preference stored in the standard user defaults (`defaults(1)`).
# 
# Changing this value at runtime works after a small delay.
auto-update = check

# The release channel to use for auto-updates.
# 
# The default value of this matches the release channel of the currently
# running Ghostty version. If you download a pre-release version of Ghostty
# then this will be set to `tip` and you will receive pre-release updates.
# If you download a stable version of Ghostty then this will be set to
# `stable` and you will receive stable updates.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `stable` - Stable, tagged releases such as "1.0.0".
#  * `tip` - Pre-release versions generated from each commit to the
#    main branch. This is the version that was in use during private
#    beta testing by thousands of people. It is generally stable but
#    will likely have more bugs than the stable channel.
# 
# Changing this configuration requires a full restart of
# Ghostty to take effect.
# 
# This only works on macOS since only macOS has an auto-update feature.
auto-update-channel = stable

# Whether to enable shell integration auto-injection or not. Shell integration
# greatly enhances the terminal experience by enabling a number of features:
# 
#   * Working directory reporting so new tabs, splits inherit the
#     previous terminal's working directory.
# 
#   * Prompt marking that enables the "jump_to_prompt" keybinding.
# 
#   * If you're sitting at a prompt, closing a terminal will not ask
#     for confirmation.
# 
#   * Resizing the window with a complex prompt usually paints much
#     better.
# 
# Allowable values are:
# 
#   * `none` - Do not do any automatic injection. You can still manually
#     configure your shell to enable the integration.
# 
#   * `detect` - Detect the shell based on the filename.
# 
#   * `bash`, `elvish`, `fish`, `zsh` - Use this specific shell injection scheme.
# 
# The default value is `detect`.
shell-integration = detect

# Shell integration features to enable. These require our shell integration
# to be loaded, either automatically via shell-integration or manually.
# 
# The format of this is a list of features to enable separated by commas. If
# you prefix a feature with `no-` then it is disabled. If you omit a feature,
# its default value is used, so you must explicitly disable features you don't
# want. You can also use `true` or `false` to turn all features on or off.
# 
# Example: `cursor`, `no-cursor`, `sudo`, `no-sudo`, `title`, `no-title`
# 
# Available features:
# 
#   * `cursor` - Set the cursor to a blinking bar at the prompt.
# 
#   * `sudo` - Set sudo wrapper to preserve terminfo.
# 
#   * `title` - Set the window title via shell integration.
# 
#   * `ssh-env` - Enable SSH environment variable compatibility. Automatically
#     converts TERM from `xterm-ghostty` to `xterm-256color` when connecting to
#     remote hosts and propagates COLORTERM, TERM_PROGRAM, and TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION.
#     Whether or not these variables will be accepted by the remote host(s) will
#     depend on whether or not the variables are allowed in their sshd_config.
#     (Available since: 1.2.0)
# 
#   * `ssh-terminfo` - Enable automatic terminfo installation on remote hosts.
#     Attempts to install Ghostty's terminfo entry using `infocmp` and `tic` when
#     connecting to hosts that lack it. Requires `infocmp` to be available locally
#     and `tic` to be available on remote hosts. Once terminfo is installed on a
#     remote host, it will be automatically "cached" to avoid repeat installations.
#     If desired, the `+ssh-cache` CLI action can be used to manage the installation
#     cache manually using various arguments.
#     (Available since: 1.2.0)
# 
#   * `path` - Add Ghostty's binary directory to PATH. This ensures the `ghostty`
#     command is available in the shell even if shell init scripts reset PATH.
#     This is particularly useful on macOS where PATH is often overridden by
#     system scripts. The directory is only added if not already present.
# 
# SSH features work independently and can be combined for optimal experience:
# when both `ssh-env` and `ssh-terminfo` are enabled, Ghostty will install its
# terminfo on remote hosts and use `xterm-ghostty` as TERM, falling back to
# `xterm-256color` with environment variables if terminfo installation fails.
